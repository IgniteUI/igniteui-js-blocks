# Ignite UI for Angular Change Log

All notable changes for each version of this project will be documented in this file.
## 11.1.1

### New Features
- `IgxAutocomplete`
    - Exported the component instance in the template with the name `igxAutocomplete`.

    ```html
    <input type="text" [igxAutocomplete]="townsPanel" #autocompleteRef="igxAutocomplete"/>
    ```

## 11.1.0

### New Features
- `IgxDropDown`
    - The `igx-drop-down-item` now allows for `igxPrefix`, `igxSuffix` and `igx-divider` directives to be passed as `ng-content` and they will be renderer accordingly in the item's content.
- `IgxGrid`
    - Added support for exporting grouped data.
- `IgxTreeGrid`
    - Added `multipleCascade` row selection mode. In this mode, selecting a record results in the selection of all its children recursively. When only some children are selected, their parent's checkbox is in an indeterminate state.
 

        ```html
        <igx-tree-grid [rowSelection]="'multipleCascade'">           
        </igx-tree-grid>
        ```
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - Support for `currency` type columns is added in the grid.
    - Support for `percent` type columns is added in the grid.
    - Added support for filtering based on the formatted cell values using the `FormattedValuesFilteringStrategy` for `IgxGrid`/`IgxHierarchicalGrid` and `TreeGridFormattedValuesFilteringStrategy` for `IgxTreeGrid`.
    - The following new events are introduced: `sorting`, `filtering`, `columnPinned`, `columnVisibilityChanging`.
    - **Behavioral Change** -
    - `onColumnPinning` to emit `IPinColumnCancellableEventArgs` instead of `IPinColumnEventArgs`.
    - `Column pinning`, `Column moving`, `paging` interactions now discard the editing value, instead of committing it.
    - `Column Resizing` now does not exit edit mode.
- `IgxInput` now supports `type="file"` and its styling upon all themes.
   _Note: validation of file type input is not yet supported._
- `igxSplitter` now has the following additional outputs: 
    - `resizeStart` - Emits when pane resizing starts.
    - `resizing`- Emits while panes are being resized.
    - `resizeEnd` - Emits when pane resizing ends.

    All emit with the two panes affected by the resize operation as arguments.

### General
- **Breaking Change** - Many outputs are renamed with the introduction of new rules in Ignite UI for Angular's naming convention. Please, ensure that when you update to 11.1 you do so through
    ```
    ng update igniteui-angular
    ```
    or execute the update migrations manually afterwards
    ```
    ng update igniteui-angular --migrate-only
    ```
    This will ensure your application is updated to use the new output names.
- `IgxCheckbox, IgxRadio, IgxSwitch` now follow the Google Material spec for focus behavior. See [checkbox](https://material.io/components/checkboxes), [radio](https://material.io/components/radio-buttons), and [switch](https://material.io/components/switches).
- `IgxDialog`
    - The dialog content has been moved inside the dialog window container in the template. This means that if you have added something in-between the opening and closing tags of the dialog, you may have to adjust its styling a bit since that content is now rendered inside a container that has padding on it.
- `IgxCalendar`
    - **Breaking Change**
    - A new string enumeration `IgxCalendarView` is exported. Either the new one or the current `CalendarView` can be used. `CalendarView` will be deprecated in a future release.

## 11.0.15

### New Features
- `IgxAutocomplete`
    - Exported the component instance in the template with the name `igxAutocomplete`.

    ```html
    <input type="text" [igxAutocomplete]="townsPanel" #autocompleteRef="igxAutocomplete"/>
    ```

## 11.0.4

### General
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - a new property `event` has been introduced to `IGridEditEventArgs` and `IGridEditDoneEventArgs`; the property represents the original DOM event that triggers any of Grid editing events like `rowEditEnter`, `cellEditEnter`, `cellEdit`, `cellEditDone`, `cellEditExit`, `rowEdit`, `rowEditDone`, `rowEditExit`
    - **Behavioral Change** -
    When there isn't a previous active node and the user enters the grid using tab or shift + tab key:
    the first fully visible element is activated: /no scroll bar positioning is reset/changed;
    If there is a previous active node in the grid - the previously active node is reactivated without resetting the scroll positions;
    If we follow the default tab navigation and we are currently on a data cell with / rowIndex: -1, columnIndex: 6/ for example
    when we tab down to the root summaries the summary cell with visible column index 6 should be activated and scroll into the view;
    The same applies if you shift+tab to the headers header cell with visible index 6 is activated and scrolled into the view;
    If you have an active node and go to another tab and then return back the active node and the current scroll position should not be changed;

## 11.0.0

### General
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - Added a new directive for re-templating the Excel style filtering header icon - `IgxExcelStyleHeaderIconDirective`.
    - **Breaking Change**

        Changed the how the grid toolbar is instantiated in the grids. The
        toolbar is now templated rather than being activated through a property on the parent grid. The toolbar features are also exposed as templatable
        components and the old properties are deprecated.

        Refer to the official documentation for more information.
- `FilteringStrategy`
    - **Breaking Change** - `filter` method exposed by the `FilteringStrategy` class now requires 3rd `advancedExpressionsTree` and 4th `grid` parameters. If not needed, just pass `null`.

### New Features
- `IgxCalendar`
    - Is now fully accessible to screen readers.

### Improvements
- `IgxOverlay`
    - New functionality to automatically determine the correct animation that is needed when showing an overlay content. This is used with Auto Position strategy, where the `IgxOverlay` content is flipped, depending on the available space.

## 10.2.15

### New Features
- `IgxAutocomplete`
    - Exported the component instance in the template with the name `igxAutocomplete`.

    ```html
    <input type="text" [igxAutocomplete]="townsPanel" #autocompleteRef="igxAutocomplete"/>
    ```

## 10.2.0

### General
- `IgxGridActions`
    - Added `asMenuItems` Input for grid actions - `igx-grid-editing-actions`, `igx-grid-pinning-actions`. When set to true will render the related action buttons as separate menu items with button and label.
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - **Behavioral Change** - The Excel Style Filtering has been reworked to provide filtering experience such as in Excel. This includes the following changes:
        - You can close the Excel Style Filtering menu by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + L`.
        - You can apply the filter by pressing `Enter`.
        - When searching items in the Excel Style Filtering menu, only the rows that match your search term will be filtered in.
        - By checking the `Add current selection to filter` option, the new search results will be added to the previously filtered items.
- `IgxInputGroup`
    - **Breaking Change** - Removed `fluent`, `fluent_search`, `bootstrap`, and `indigo` as possible values for the `type` input property.
    - **Behavioral Change** - The styling of the input group is now dictated by the theme being used. The remaining `types` - `line`, `border`, and `box` will only have effect on the styling when used with the `material` theme. The `search` type will affect styling when used with all themes. Changing the theme at runtime will not change the styling of the input group, a page refresh is required.
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - **Rename outputs**
        `onRowEditEnter` to `rowEditEnter`
        `onCellEditEnter` to `cellEditEnter`
        `onCellEdit` to `cellEdit`
        `onRowEdit` to `rowEdit`
    - **Breaking Change** - The `onCellEditCancel` event is replaced by the new `cellEditExit` event that emits every time the editable cell exits edit mode.
    - **Breaking Change** - The `onRowEditCancel` event is replaced by the new `rowEditExit` event that emits every time the editable row exits edit mode.
- `IgxOverlay`

    - `onOpening` and `onClosing` events are emitting now arguments of `ToggleViewCancelableEventArgs` type.
- `IgxSelect`
    - Added `aria-labelledby` property for the items list container(marked as `role="listbox"`). This will ensure the users of assistive technologies will also know what the list items container is used for, upon opening.
- `IgxDatePicker`
    - **Breaking Change** - Deprecated the `label` property.
    - Added `aria-labelledby` property for the input field. This will ensure the users of assistive technologies will also know what component is used for, upon input focus.
- `igxNavigationDrawer`
    - Added `disableAnimation` property which enables/disables the animation, when toggling the drawer. Set to `false` by default.
- `igxTabs`
    - Added `disableAnimation` property which enables/disables the transition animation of the tabs' content. Set to `false` by default.

### New Features
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - When triggering an export of the grid via the toolbar and the export takes more than 500 milliseconds, the export button becomes disabled and an indeterminate progress bar is shown at the bottom of the toolbar until the export is finished.
    - `cellEditExit` is a new event that fires when cell exits edit mode
    - `rowEditExit` is a new event that fires when row exits edit mode
    - Added *getRowData(rowSelector)* method that returns an object that represents the data that is contained in the specified row component.
    - Added ability to spawn row adding UI through exposed methods. Note that rowEditing should be enabled.
        - `beginAddRow` method which starts the adding row UI.
        - `beginAddChild` method which starts the adding child UI.
        ```typescript
        this.grid.beginAddRow(rowID);
        ```
        - Added an input properties to `IgxGridEditingActions` component to show/hide add row and add child buttons which trigger the UI based on context expression.
        ```html
        <igx-tree-grid [rowEditing]="true">
            <igx-action-strip #actionStrip>
                <igx-grid-editing-actions [addRow]="true" [addChild]="actionStrip.context.level < 3">
                </igx-grid-editing-actions>
            </igx-action-strip>
        </igx-tree-grid>
        ```
    - A new `locale` and `pipeArgs` parameters are introduced in the `operate` method exposed by the `IgxNumberSummaryOperand` and `IgxDateSummaryOperand`, which exposes the grid locale. Use the `locale` parameter to get localized summary data (as per the grid locale. If not passed, `locale` defaults to `'en-US'`). Use the `pipeArgs` parameter only if you want to customize the format of the date and numeric values that will be returned.
    ```typescript
    class MySummary extends IgxDateSummaryOperand {
        operate(columnData: any[], allData = [], fieldName, locale: string, pipeArgs: IColumnPipeArgs): IgxSummaryResult[] {
            const pipeArgs: IColumnPipeArgs = {
                format: 'longDate',
                timezone: 'UTC',
                digitsInfo: '1.1-2'
            }
            const result = super.operate(columnData, allData, fieldName, locale, pipeArgs);
            return result;
        }
    }
    ```
    - A new `pipeArgs` input property is exposed by the `IgxColumnComponent`, which is used to pass arguments to the Angular `DatePipe` and `DecimalPipe`, to format the display for date and numeric columns.
    ```typescript
- ` IGX_INPUT_GROUP_TYPE` injection token
    - Allows for setting an input group `type` on a global level, so all input-group instances, including components using such an instance as a template will have their input group type set to the one specified by the token. It can be overridden on a component level by explicitly setting a `type`.
- ` IgxExcelExporterService`
    - Added `worksheetName` property to the `IgxExcelExporterOptions`, that allows setting the name of the worksheet.
- `IgxDatePicker`
    - The the `label` property have been deprecated and a custom label can also be set by nesting a <label igxLabel></label> inside the <igx-date-picker><igx-date-picker> tags.
- `IgxTimePicker`
    - Added a custom label functionality.
- `IgxCalendar` and `IgxDatePicker` - new `showWeekNumbers` input, that allows showing of the week number at left side of content area.
- `IgxOverlay`
    - The `PositionSettings` `target` property has been deprecated and moved to `OverlaySettings`.
    - An optional Point/HTML Element parameter `target` has been added to the `position()` method
    - Added `createAbsoluteOverlaySettings` and `createRelativeOverlaySettings` methods which create non-modal `OverlaySettings` based on predefined `PositionSettings`. The methods are exposed off the `IgxOverlayService`.
        - `createAbsoluteOverlaySettings` creates non-modal `OverlaySettings` with `GlobalPositionStrategy` or `ContainerPositionStrategy` if an outlet is provided. Accepts `AbsolutePosition` enumeration, which could be `Center`, `Top` and `Bottom`. Default is `Center`.
        ```typescript
            const globalOverlaySettings = IgxOverlayService.createAbsoluteOverlaySettings(AbsolutePosition.Top);
        ```
        - `createRelativeOverlaySettings` creates `OverlaySettings` with `AutoPositionStrategy`, `ConnectedPositioningStrategy` or `ElasticPositionStrategy`. Accepts target, strategy and position. The `target` is the attaching point or element for the component to show. The position strategy is a `RelativePositionStrategy` enumeration, which defaults to `Auto`. The position is a `RelativePosition` enumeration. Possible values are `Above`, `Below`, `Before`, `After` and `Default`. The default option is `Default`, which positions the element below the target, left aligned.
        ```typescript
            const targetElement = this.button.nativeElement;
            const connectedOverlaySettings = IgxOverlayService.createRelativeOverlaySettings(
                    targetElement,
                    RelativePositionStrategy.Connected,
                    RelativePosition.Above);
        ```
- `IgxToast`
    - The component now utilizes the `IgxOverlayService` to position itself in the DOM.
    - An additional input property `outlet` has been added to allow users to specify custom Overlay Outlets using the `IgxOverlayOutletDirective`;
    - The `position` property now accepts values of type `IgxToastPosition` that work with strict templates.
- `IgxExpansionPanelHeader`
    - `onInteraction` is now cancelable
    - Added `iconRef` property. This can be used to get a reference to the displayed expand/collapsed indicator. Returns `null` if `iconPosition` is set to `NONE`.

## 10.1.0

### General
- `igxCombo`
    - **Behavioral Change** - Change default positioning strategy from `ConnectedPositioningStrategy` to `AutoPositionStrategy`. The [`Auto`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/overlay-position#auto) strategy will initially try to show the element like the Connected strategy does. If the element goes out of the viewport Auto will flip the starting point and the direction, i.e. if the direction is 'bottom', it will switch it to 'top' and so on. If after flipping direction the content goes out of the view, auto strategy will revert to initial start point and direction and will push the content into the view. Note after pushing the content it may hide the combo's input.
    - Make `onSearchInput` event cancellable. The event args type has been changed to `IComboSearchInputEventArgs`, which have the following properties: `searchText` - holds the text typed into the search input, `owner` - holds a reference to the combo component and `cancel` - indicates whether the event should be canceled.
- `IgxOverlay`
    - Added new property `closeOnEscape` in `OverlaySettings` that controls whether the overlay should close on escape keypress. By default `closeOnEsc` is set to `false`.
    - **Behavioral Change** - `modal` overlays shown directly through the Overlay Service no longer close on Escape by default. That behavior can now be specified using the `closeOnEscape` property.
- `igxDialog`
    - Added `closeOnEscape` - with it, the dialog can be allowed or prevented from closing when `Esc` is pressed.
- `IgxNavbar`:
    - **Breaking Changes** - The `igx-action-icon` has been renamed to `igx-navbar-action`. It should get renamed in your components via `ng update`;
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - **Breaking Change** - The `selectedRows` method is now an `@Input` property. Setting it to an array of Row IDs will update the grid's selection state, any previous selection will be cleared. Setting it to an empty array will clear the selection entirely.
    - **Breaking Change** - Removed `IgxExcelStyleSortingTemplateDirective`, `IgxExcelStyleHidingTemplateDirective`, `IgxExcelStyleMovingTemplateDirective`, `IgxExcelStylePinningTemplateDirective` and `IgxExcelStyleSelectingTemplateDirective` directives for re-templating the Excel style filter menu. Added two new directives for re-templating the column operations and filter operations areas - `IgxExcelStyleColumnOperationsTemplateDirective` and `IgxExcelStyleFilterOperationsTemplateDirective`. Exposed all internal components of the Excel style filter menu in order to be used inside the templates.
    - **Breaking Change** - `IgxColumnHiding` and `IgxColumnPinning` components have been deprecated in favor of a component combining the their functionality - `IgxColumnActions` which is used with either of the new `IgxColumnPinning` and `IgxColumnHiding` directives that specify the action to be triggered through the UI.
    - Added `move` method which allows to move a column to a specified visible index. The method is exposed off the `IgxColumnComponent`.
- `igxGrid`
    - **Behavioral Change** - For numeric columns, the onCellEdit arguments' newValue will now contain the numeric value that will be committed instead of the string input.
    - Added `onScroll` event, which is emitted when the grid is scrolled vertically or horizontally.
    - Each grid now expose a default handling for boolean column types. The column will display `check` or `close` icon, instead of true/false by default.
- `igxTreeGrid`
    - Removed `onDataPreLoad` event as it is specific for remote virtualization implementation, which is not supported for the `igxTreeGrid`. A more generic `onScroll` event is exposed and can be used instead.
- `IgxTimePicker`
    - Added a disabled style for time parts outside of the minimum and maximum range.
- `igxDatePicker`
    -  Added new property - `editorTabIndex`, that allows setting tabindex for the default editor.

### New Theme
Ignite UI for Angular now has a new theme based on our own design system.
You can use one of the following mixins to include a dark or light indigo theme:
`igx-indigo-light-theme` and `igx-indigo-dark-theme`

We also added two new palettes that go with the new theme, `$light-indigo-palette` and `$dark-indigo-palette`.

The following example shows how you can use the Indigo theme:

```scss
// Light version
.indigo-theme {
    @include igx-indigo-light-theme($light-indigo-palette);
}

// Dark version
.indigo-dark-theme {
    @include igx-indigo-dark-theme($dark-indigo-palette);
}
```

    - **Behavioral Change** - The select, combo, and dropdown items now have display block and text-overflow ellipsis enabled by default. This requires styling to be handled on the application-level if there is something more than a simple text in the item.
- `IgxTransaction` - The `onStateUpdate` now emits with information of its origin. The emitted value is of type `StateUpdateEvent`, which has two properties:
    - `origin` - it can vary within the values of the `TransactionEventOrigin` interface;
    - `actions` - contains information about the transactions, that caused the emission of the event.
- `IgxPaginator` - The input `overlaySettings` was introduced, which allows applying custom overlay settings for the component.

### New Features
- `IgxGrid`
    - `showGroupArea` input is added, which can be used to enable/disable the group area row.
    - The event arguments of `onCellEdit`, `onCellEditEnter` and `onCellEditCancel` events will contain a reference to the row data, as well as a reference to the column.
    - The event arguments of `onRowEdit`, `onRowEditEnter` and `onRowEditCancel` events will contain a reference to the row data.

- `IgxSelect` support for `igxHint` directive added.
    - Allows the user to add `igxHint` to be displayed bellow the input element.

## 9.1.9

### New Features
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - Expose a setter for grid's `outlet` property, which can be used to set the outlet used to attach the grid's overlays to.

## 9.1.4

### New Features
- `IgxList`
    - Added localization support.

## 9.1.1

### General
- `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - `onGridInitialized` - New output has been exposed. Emitted after a grid is being initialized for the corresponding row island.
-  **Behavioral Change** - When moving a column `DropPosition.None` is now acting like `DropPosition.AfterDropTarget`.

## 9.1.0

### General
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - **Behavioral Change** - When a column is sortable sort indicator is always visible. The column is sorted when click on it.
- `igx-paginator` -  The following inputs have been deprecated for the `paginator` component and will be removed in future versions
    - `selectLabel` and `prepositionPage` Use 'resourceStrings' to set/get values.

- `IgxInputGroup`
  - **Renamed** `supressInputAutofocus` input to `suppressInputAutofocus`
  - Clicking on prefix, suffix or label elements in the Input Group will no longer blur and re-focus the input.

### Themes
- **Breaking Change**  Change the default `$legacy-support` value to false in the `igx-theme` function.

### New Features

- `IgxDateTimeEditor` directive added.
    - Allows the user to set and edit `date` and `time` in a chosen input element.
    - Can edit `date` or `time` portion, using an editable masked input.
    - Additionally, can specify a desired `display` and `input` `format`, as well as `min` and `max` values.

    - A basic configuration scenario setting a Date object as a `value`:
    ```html
    <igx-input-group>
        <input type="text" igxInput igxDateTimeEditor [value]="date"/>
    </igx-input-group>
    ```
    - Two-way data-binding via an ngModel:
    ```html
    <igx-input-group>
        <input type="text" igxInput igxDateTimeEditor [(ngModel)]="date"/>
    </igx-input-group>
    ```
- `IgxDateRangePicker` component added.
    - Allows the selection of a range of dates from a calendar UI or input fields. Supports `dialog` and `dropdown` modes.
    - Added `IgxDateRangeStartComponent` and `IgxDateRangeEndComponent`.
    - The default template consists of a single *readonly* field:
    ```html
    <igx-date-range-picker [(ngModel)]="range"></igx-date-range-picker>
    ```
    - Projection of input fields using `igxDateTimeEditor`
        ```html
        <igx-date-range-picker>
            <igx-date-range-start>
                <input igxInput igxDateTimeEditor [(ngModel)]="range.start">
            </igx-date-range-start>
            <igx-date-range-end>
                <input igxInput igxDateTimeEditor [(ngModel)]="range.end">
            </igx-date-range-end>
        </igx-date-range-picker>
        ```
    - Added `IgxPickerToggleComponent` which allows templating of the default icon in the input through `igxPrefix` and `igxSuffix`.
        - default template:
        ```html
        <igx-date-range-picker>
            <igx-picker-toggle igxSuffix>
                <igx-icon>calendar_view_day</igx-icon>
            </igx-picker-toggle>
        </igx-date-range-picker>
        ```
        - with projections:
        ```html
        <igx-date-range-picker>
            <igx-date-range-start>
                ...
                <igx-picker-toggle igxPrefix>
                    <igx-icon>calendar_view_day</igx-icon>
                </igx-picker-toggle>
                ...
            </igx-date-range-start>
            <igx-date-range-end>
                ...
            </igx-date-range-end>
        </igx-date-range-picker>
        ```

- `IgxActionStrip` component added.
    - Provides a template area for one or more actions. In its simplest form the Action Strip
        is an overlay of any container and shows additional content over that container.

    ```html
    <igx-action-strip #actionstrip>
        <igx-icon (click)="doSomeAction()"></igx-icon>
    </igx-action-strip>
    ```

- `igxSplitter` component added.
    - Allows rendering a vertical or horizontal splitter with multiple splitter panes with templatable content.
        Panes can be resized or collapsed/expanded via the UI. Splitter orientation is defined via the `type` input.

     ```html
   <igx-splitter [type]="type">
        <igx-splitter-pane>
			...
        </igx-splitter-pane>
        <igx-splitter-pane>
			...
        </igx-splitter-pane>
    </igx-splitter>
    ```

- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - Added ability to pin rows to top or bottom depending on the new `pinning` input.
    And new API methods `pinRow` and `unpinRow`.
    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data" [pinning]="pinningConfiguration"></igx-grid>
    ```
    ```typescript
    public pinningConfiguration: IPinningConfig = { rows: RowPinningPosition.Bottom };
    ```
    ```typescript
    this.grid.pinRow(rowID);
    ```
    - Added support for pinning columns on the right. Change the position of pinning using the new `pinning` input.
    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data" [pinning]="pinningConfiguration"></igx-grid>
    ```
    ```typescript
    public pinningConfiguration: IPinningConfig = { columns: ColumnPinningPosition.End };
    ```
  - Added new properties for paging:
    - `totalRecords` set to alter the pages count based on total remote records. Keep in mind that If you are using paging and all the data is passed to the grid, the value of totalRecords property will be set by default to the length of the provided data source. If totalRecords is set, it will take precedent over the default length based on the data source.
    - `pagingMode` - accepts `GridPagingMode` enumeration. If the paging mode is set to remote the grid will not paginate the passed data source, if the paging mode is set to local (which is the default value) the grid will paginate the data source based on the page, perPage and totalRecords values.
    - Added functionality for column selection.
    - `columnSelection` property has been added. It accepts GridSelection mode enumeration. Grid selection mode could be none, single or multiple.
    - `selected` property has been added to the IgxColumnComponent; Allows you to set whether the column is selected.
    - `selectable` property has been added to the IgxColumnComponent; Allows you to set whether the column is selectable.
    - `onColumnSelectionChange` event is added for the `IgxGrid`. It is emitted when the column selection is changed.
    - `excelStyleSelectingTemplate` property is introduced to IgxGrid, which allows you to set a custom template for the selecting a column in the Excel Style Filter.
    - `selectedColumns` API method is added for the `IgxGrid`. It allows to get all selected columns.
    - `selectColumns` API method is added for the `IgxGrid`. It allows to select columns by passing array of IgxColumnComponent or column fields.
    - `deselectColumns` API method is added for the `IgxGrid`. It allows to deselect columns by passing array of IgxColumnComponent or column fields.
    - `deselectAllColumns` API method is added for the `IgxGrid`. It allows to deselect all columns.
    - `getSelectedColumnsData` API method is added for the `IgxGrid`. It allows to get the selected columns data.
    Added keyBoard navigation support in the IgxGrid headers. Now is possible to navigate with the arrows keys through grid headers. Also we provide a number of key combinations that trigger a different column functionality like filtering, sorting, grouping and etc. You can read more information in the [Grid Specification](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/igxGrid-Specification#kb-navigation).
    - **Behavioral Change**
        - *you can not use* `tab` key to navigate between the cell in the Igx Grid. The navigation is performed only with arrow keys.
        - when you are in edit mode with `tab` key you can navigate to the next editable cell.
        - `page up` and `page down` keys will perform action only if the focused element is the tbody of the grid.
        - The grid introduces the following basic `tab stops`:
            - Toolbar / Group by Area if existing;
            - The first cell in the header row;
            - The first cell in the first body row;
            - The first cell in column summary if exists;
            - Pager UI;

- `IgxCombo`:
    - Added `autoFocusSearch` input that allows to manipulate the combo's opening behavior. When the property is `true` (by default), the combo's search input is focused on open. When set to `false`, the focus goes to the combo items container, which can be used to prevent the software keyboard from activating on mobile devices when opening the combo.

- `IgxToast`:
    - Added functionality for displaying various content into the toast component. It also allows users to access toast styles through its host element.

- `IgxDrag`
    - Added `igxDragIgnore` directive that allows children of the `igxDrag` element to be interactable and receive mouse events. Dragging cannot be performed from those elements that are ignored.
    - Added `dragDirection` input that can specify only one direction of dragging or both.

- `IgxChip`
    - Added support for tabIndex attribute applied to the main chip element.
    - Added `tabIndex` input so it can support change detection as well.

- `IgxHighlightDirective`
    - New `metadata` property was introduced, which allows adding additional, custom logic to the activation condition of a highlighted element.

### RTL Support

- **Breaking Changes** Due to a breaking change in Angular 9 with Ivy, Hammer providers are no longer included by default. You can find more information at: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-9 . Because of this change the following components require `HammerModule` to be imported in the root module of the application in order for user interactions to work as expected:
    - `IgxSlider`

    The following components require `HammerModule` to be imported in the root module of the application so that their **touch** interactions work as expected:
    - `igxGrid`
    - `igxHierarchicalGrid`
    - `igxTreeGrid`
    - `igxList`
    - `igxNavigationDrawer`
    - `igxTimePicker`

    - `igxCarousel`

- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - **Breaking Change** - Hierarchical grid children no longer use the same `IgxTransactionService` instance and transaction handling should be modified to address each grid's transactions separately.
    - **Behavioral Change** - Pinning columns is no longer automatically prevented when the pinning area would exceed the size of the grid.
    - **Breaking Change** - The following input and output have been deprecated for the `igxHierarchicalGrid` and will be removed in future versions:
        - `hierarchicalState` -> `expansionStates` should be used instead.
        - `hierarchicalStateChange` -> `expansionStatesChange` should be used instead.

    - `igxGridState` directive added to make it easy for developers to save and restore the grid state. The directive exposes the `getState` and `setState` methods to save/restore the state and an `options` input property to exclude features.
- `IgxCarousel`:
    - **Breaking Changes** -The carousel slides are no longer array, they are changed to QueryList.
    - **Behavioral change** - When slides are more than 5, a label is shown instead of the indicators. The count limit of visible indicators can be changed with the input `maximumIndicatorsCount`
- `IgxAvatar`:
    - **Breaking Changes** - renamed the `default` enumeration member to `custom` in `IgxAvatarType`;

- `igxOverlay`:
    - **Behavioral Change** - `igxOverlay` - no longer persists element scrolling `out of the box`. In order to persist an element scroll position after attaching the element to an overlay, handle the exposed `onAppended` overlay event and manage/restore the scroll position.

### New Features
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`:
    - Master-Detail visualization added for `igxGrid`. Users may now define templates that show additional context for rows when expanded. For more information, please take a look at the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/master-detail).
    - `sortStrategy` input is added, which can be used to set a global sorting strategy for the entire grid.
        (**NOTE**: The grid's `sortStrategy` is of different type compared to the column's `sortStrategy`.)
    - `NoopSortingStrategy` is added, which can be used to disable the default sorting of the grid by assigning its instance to the grid's `sortStrategy` input. (Useful for remote sorting.)
    - `NoopFilteringStrategy` is added, which can be used to disable the default filtering of the grid by assigning its instance to the grid's `filterStrategy` input. (Useful for remote filtering.)
    - `sortingExpressionsChange` event emitter is added, which is fired whenever a change to the sorting expressions has occurred (prior to performing the actual sorting).
    - `filteringExpressionsTreeChange` event emitter is added, which is fired whenever a change to the filtering expressions has occurred (prior to performing the actual filtering).
    - `advancedFilteringExpressionsTreeChange` event emitter is added, which is fired whenever a change to the advanced filtering expressions has occurred (prior to performing the actual filtering).
    - `collapsible` and `expanded` properties are added to the IgxColumnGroupComponent; `collapsible` property identifies that certain column group is collapsible; `expanded` identifies whether the group is expanded or collapsed initially;
    - `collapsibleChange` and `expandedChange` events are added to the IgxColumnGroupComponent which are emitted whenever `collapsible` and `expanded` properties are changed accordingly;
    - `visibleWhenCollapsed` property has been added to the IgxColumnComponent; Allows you to set whether the column stay visible when its parent is collapsed.
    - `visibleWhenCollapsedChange` events is added to the IgxColumnComponent which are emitted whenever `visibleWhenCollapsed`  property is changed;
    - `collapsibleIndicatorTemplate` property is introduced to IgxColumnGroupComponent, which allows you to set a custom template for the expand collapse indicator;
    - `igxCollapsibleIndicator` directive has been introduced, which allows you to set a custom template for the expand collapse indicator;
    - `IgxGridExcelStyleFilteringComponent` and `IgxAdvancedFilteringDialogComponent` can now be hosted outside of the grid in order to provide the same experience as the built-in filtering UI.
    - `expandRow(rowID)`/`collapseRow(rowID)`/`toggleRow(rowID)` API methods are added for the `igxHierarchicalGrid`. They allow expanding/collapsing a row by its id.
    - `onRowToggle` event is added for the `igxHierarchicalGrid`. It is emitted when the expanded state of a row is changed.
    - `IgxRowDragGhost` directive is added. It allows providing a custom template for the drag ghost when dragging a row.
    ```html
    <igx-grid #grid1 [data]="remote | async" primaryKey="ProductID"
        [rowDraggable]="true">
        <igx-column field="ProductName"></igx-column>
        <igx-column field="ProductID"></igx-column>
        <igx-column field="UnitsInStock"></igx-column>
        <ng-template let-data igxRowDragGhost>
            <div>
                Moving {{data.ProductName}}!
            </div>
        </ng-template>
    </igx-grid>
    ```
- `IgxSlider`:
    - **Breaking Change** - `isContinuous` - input has been deleted. The option is not supported anymore.
    - `primaryTicks` input was added. Which sets the number of primary ticks
    - `secondaryTicks` input was added. Which sets the number of secondary ticks.

    - `gesturesSupport` input is added, which can be used to enable and disable gestures
    - `maximumIndicatorsCount` input is added, which can be used to set the number of visible indicators
    - `indicatorsOrientation` input is added, which can be used to set the position of indicators it can be top or bottom
    - `animationType` input is added, which can be used to set animation when changing slides
    - `indicatorTemplate` directive is added, which can be used to provide a custom indicator for carousel. If this property is not provided, a default indicator template will be used instead.
    - `nextButtonTemplate` directive is added, which is used to provide a custom next button template. If not provided, a default next button is used.
    - `prevButtonTemplate` directive is added, which is used to provide a custom previous button template. If not provided, a default previous button is used.

- `IgxSelect`:
    - adding `IgxSelectHeaderDirective` and `IgxSelectFooterDirective`. These can be used to provide a custom header, respectively footer templates for the `igxSelect` drop-down list. If there are no templates marked with these directives - no default templates will be used so the drop-down list will not have header nor footer.

- `IgxCombo`:
    - Added `displayText` property to the combo's `onSelectionChange` event args. The property contains the text that will be populated in the combo's text box **after** selection completes. This text can be overwritten in order to display a custom message, e.g. "3 items selected":
    ```html
    <igx-combo [data]="people" valueKey="id" displayKey="name" placeholder="Invite friends..." (onSelectionChange)="handleSelection($event)">
    ```
    ```typescript
    export class MyInvitationComponent {
        public people: { name: string; id: string }[] = [...];
        ...
        handleSelection(event: IComboSelectionChangeEventArgs) {
            const count = event.newSelection.length;
            event.displayText = count > 0 ? `${count} friend(s) invited!` : `No friends invited :(`;
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

- `IgxDropDown`:
    - `clearSelection` method is added, which can be used to deselect the selected dropdown item

- `IgxToggleDirective`:
    - `setOffset` method added. It offsets the content along the corresponding axis by the provided amount.

- `IgxOverlayService`:
    - `setOffset` method added. It offsets the content along the corresponding axis by the provided amount.

- `IgxCircularProgressBar`:
    - added `IgxProgressBarGradientDirective` to allow providing custom circular progress SVG gradients. Providing a custom gradient via a template is as easy as writing:
    ```html
    <igx-circular-bar [value]="77">
        <ng-template igxProgressBarGradient let-id>
            <svg:linearGradient [id]="id" gradientTransform="rotate(90)">
                <stop offset="0%"   stop-color="#05a"/>
                <stop offset="100%" stop-color="#0a5"/>
            </svg:linearGradient>
        </ng-template>
    </igx-circular-bar>
    ```
    - changed the `igx-progress-circular-theme` to accept a list of 2 colors for the `$progress-circle-color` argument, making it easier to modify the default gradient:
    ```scss
    $theme: igx-progress-circular-theme(
        $progress-circle-color: red blue
    );

    @include igx-progress-circular($theme);
    ```
    - RTL support

- `IgxForOf`
    - `IgxForTotalItemCount` input is added for the cases when the data is from remote services. This will allow setting the count of the items through the template. And gives the opportunity for the developers to use AsyncPipe for this option:
    ```html
    <ng-template igxFor let-item [igxForOf]="data | async" [igxForTotalItemCount]="count | async"
        [igxForContainerSize]="'500px'" [igxForItemSize]="'50px'"></ng-template>
    ```

## 8.2.6

### New Features
- `IgxSelectItem`
    - `text` input is added. By default, the Select component will display the selected item's element inner text. In cases with a more complex item template, where more than just text interpolation is used, set the text property to specify what to display in the select field when the item is selected.


## 8.2.4
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - The header text of the columns and the column groups now has the `title` attribute set to it in order to expose a native browser tooltip.

### RTL Support
Most of the components in the framework now have full right-to-left (RTL) support via the newly included RTL themes.

For CSS-based projects add `node_modules/igniteui-angular/styles/igniteui-angular-rtl.css` to your angular.json styles collection.

For Sass-based projects pass `$direction` to the `igx-core` mixin in your root stylesheet.

Example:
```scss
// $direction defaults to ltr if it's omitted.
@include igx-core($direction: rtl);
```
Currently the following components have only partial RTL support:
 - Grid (igx-grid)
 - Slider (igx-slider)
 - Tabs (igx-tabs)
 - Circular Progress Indicator (igx-circular-bar)

 We plan on adding support for the aforementioned components in the upcoming releases.

### New Features

- Columns now expose the `cellStyles` property which allows conditional styling of the column cells. Similar to `cellClasses` it accepts an object literal where the keys are style properties and the values are expressions for evaluation.
```typescript
styles = {
    color: '#123456',
    'font-family': 'monospace'
    'font-weight': (_, __, value) => value.startsWith('!') : 'red' : 'inherit'
};
```
The callback signature for both `cellStyles` and `cellClasses` is now changed to

```typescript
(rowData: any, columnKey: string, cellValue: any, rowIndex: number) => boolean
```

## 8.2.3
- `IgxTextHighlightDirective` - The default highlight directive styles have been moved to a Sass theme - `igx-highlight-theme`; You can modify the resting and active background and text color styles of the directive by passing the respective properties to the Sass theme. You can still pass your own CSS classes to the highlight directive via the cssClass and activeCssClass inputs.

- `IgxChip`
    - **Breaking Change** The `originalEvent` property for the events `onMoveStart`, `onMoveEnd`, `onClick` and `onSelection` now provides the events, passed from the `igxDrag` directive. The passed original events are in other words the previous events that triggered the `igxChip` ones. They also have original events until a browser event is reached.
- `IgxGrid` - Now you can access all grid data inside the custom column summary. Two additional optional parameters are introduced in the IgxSummaryOperand `operate` method.

```typescript
class MySummary extends IgxNumberSummaryOperand {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }
    operate(columnData: any[], allGridData = [], fieldName?): IgxSummaryResult[] {
        const result = super.operate(allData.map(r => r[fieldName]));
        result.push({ key: 'test', label: 'Total Discounted', summaryResult: allData.filter((rec) => rec.Discontinued).length });
        return result;
    }
}
```

## 8.2.0
### New theme
Ignite UI for angular now have a new theme that mimics Microsoft "Fluent" design system.
Depending on your use case you can use one of the following mixins:
`igx-fluent-theme` and `igx-fluent-dark-theme`

We also added two new palettes that go with the new theme, `$fluent-word-palette` and `$fluent-excel-palette`.

Next example shows how you can use the Fluent theme.

```scss
// Light version
.fluent-word-theme {
    @include igx-fluent-theme($fluent-word-palette);
}

// Dark version
.fluent-excel-dark-theme {
    @include igx-fluent-dark-theme($fluent-excel-palette);
}
```

### Theme Changes
`igx-badge-theme` - Removed the `$disable-shadow` property to mitigate confusion when specifying `$shadow` explicitly.

For more information about the theming please read our [documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/themes/index.html)

### New Features
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - Advanced Filtering functionality is added. In the advanced filtering dialog, you could create groups of conditions across all grid columns. The advanced filtering button is shown in the grid's toolbar when `allowAdvancedFiltering` and `showToolbar` properties are set to `true`. You could also open/close the advanced filtering dialog using the `openAdvancedFilteringDialog` and `closeAdvancedFilteringDialog` methods.
    - `uniqueColumnValuesStrategy` input is added. This property provides a callback for loading unique column values on demand. If this property is provided, the unique values it generates will be used by the Excel Style Filtering (instead of using the unique values from the data that is bound to the grid).
    - `[filterStrategy] - input that allows you to override the default filtering strategy`
    - `igxExcelStyleLoading` directive is added, which can be used to provide a custom loading template for the Excel Style Filtering. If this property is not provided, a default loading template will be used instead.
    - introduced new properties `cellSelection` and `rowSelection` which accept GridSelection mode enumeration. Grid selection mode could be none, single or multiple. Also `hideRowSelectors` property is added, which allows you to show and hide row selectors when row selection is enabled.
    - introduced functionality for templating row and header selectors - [spec](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/Row-Selection-Templating-(Grid-feature))
    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data", [rowSelection]="'multiple'" primaryKey="ID">
        <igx-column field="Name"></igx-column>
        <igx-column field="Age"></igx-column>

        <ng-template igxHeadSelector let-headSelector>
            <igx-icon>done_all</igx-icon>
        </ng-template>
        <ng-template igxRowSelector let-rowContext>
            <igx-switch [checked]="rowContext.selected"></igx-switch>
        </ng-template>
    </igx-grid>
    ```
- `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - Row Islands now emit child grid events with an additional argument - `owner`, which holds reference to the related child grid component instance.
- `IgxDrag`
    - Dragging without ghost. Now it is possible to drag the base element `igxDrag` is instanced on by setting the new input `ghost` to false.
    - Ghost template. A custom ghost template reference can be provided on the new `ghostTemplate` input.
    - Dragging using a single or multiple handles. New `igxDragHandle` directive is exposed to specify a handle by which an element can be interacted with instead of the whole element `igxDrag` is instanced on.
    - Linking of drag and drop elements. This can be achieved by using the new provided `dragChannel` input, specifying each element to which channel it corresponds.
    - Drag animation improvements. Three new methods have been exposed in place of the old `animateToOrigin` input in order to provide more flexibility when wanting to have transition animation to specific position when dropping. `setLocation`, `transitionToOrigin` and `transitionTo` are all methods that provide a various way to animate a transition to a specific location for the dragged element.
    - New getters - `location` and `originLocation` to aid in applying transition animations.
    - New outputs - `dragMove`, `ghostCreate` and `ghostDestroy`
- `IgxDrop`
    - Linking of drag and drop elements. This can be achieved by using the new provided `dropChannel` input, specifying each drop area to which channel it corresponds.
    - Drop strategies. Three new drop strategies have been provided - Append, Prepend and Insert.  Also an input `dropStrategy` to the `igxDrop` which specify which strategy should be used when dropping an element inside the drop area. Custom one can be specified as well.
- `IgxCheckbox`
    - introduced a new `readonly` property that doesn't allow user interaction to change the state, but keeps the default active style. Intended for integration in complex controls that handle the interaction and control the checkbox instead through binding.
- `IgxOverlay`
    - introduced a new `ContainerPositionStrategy`. The new strategy positions the element inside the containing outlet based on the directions passed in trough PositionSettings.
- `IgxChip`
    - add `onSelectionDone` event that is triggered after all animations and transitions related to selection have ended.

### General
- `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid`, `IgxHierarchicalGrid`
    - `isCellSelected` method has been deprecated. Now you can use `selected` property.
    - `rowSelectable` property has been deprecated. Now you can use `rowSelection` property to enable row selection and also you can show and hide the row selectors by setting `hideRowSelectors` property to true or false (which is the default value).

    ```
    ```typescript
    export class MyCombo {

            ...
            handleChange(event: IComboSelectionChangeEventArgs) {
            console.log("Items added: ", [...event.added]); // the items added to the selection in this change

### Features
- `igxGrid`
    - **Feature** `igxGridComponent` now supports [Multi Row Layouts](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/Grid---Multi-Row-Layout). It is configured with the newly added `IgxColumnLayoutComponent` and the columns in it. `IgxColumnComponent` now expose four new fields to determine the size and the location of the field into the layout:
        - [`colStart`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcolumncomponent#colstart) - column index from which the field is starting. This property is **mandatory**.
         - [`rowStart`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcolumncomponent.html#rowstart) - row index from which the field is starting. This property is **mandatory**.
         - [`colEnd`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcolumncomponent.html#colend) - column index where the current field should end. The amount of columns between colStart and colEnd will determine the amount of spanning columns to that field. This property is **optional**. If not set defaults to `colStart + 1`.
         - [`rowEnd`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcolumncomponent.html#rowend) - row index where the current field should end. The amount of rows between rowStart and rowEnd will determine the amount of spanning rows to that field. This property is **optional**. If not set defaults to `rowStart + 1`.
         ```html
        <igx-column-layout>
             <igx-column [rowStart]="1" [colStart]="1" field="Country"></igx-column>
             <igx-column [rowStart]="1" [colStart]="2" field="City"></igx-column>
             <igx-column [rowStart]="2" [colStart]="1" [colEnd]="3" field="Address"></igx-column>
        </igx-column-layout>
        ```
- `igxGrid`, `igxTreeGrid`, `igxHierarchicalGrid`
    - **Feature** Grid components now supports [Grid Row Dragging ](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/Row-Dragging). It lets users pass the data of a grid record on to another surface, which has been configured to process/render this data. It can be enabled by using the `rowDraggable` input of the grid.

    - **Feature** The Excel Style Filter dialog and its sub-dialogs now have a display density based on the `displayDensity` input of their respective grid.
- `igxTreeGrid`
    - **Feature** The `IgxTreeGridComponent` now supports loading child rows on demand using the newly added `loadChildrenOnDemand` and `hasChildrenKey` input properties.
- `IgxListComponent`
    - **Feature** The `IgxListComponent` now provides the ability to choose a display density from a predefined set of options: **compact**, **cosy** and **comfortable** (default one). It can be set by using the `displayDensity` input of the list.
- `igxButton`
    - **Feature** The `igxButton` now provides the ability to choose a display density from a predefined set of options: **compact**, **cosy** and **comfortable** (default one). It can be set by using the `displayDensity` input of the button directive.
- `igxButtonGroup`
    - **Feature** The `igxButtonGroup` now provides the ability to choose a display density from a predefined set of options: **compact**, **cosy** and **comfortable** (default one). It can be set by using the `displayDensity` input of the button group. The buttons within the group will have the same density as the button group. If a button has the `displayDensity` set in the template, it is not changed by the density of the group where the button is placed.
- `igxGrid`, `igxTreeGrid`, `igxHierarchicalGrid`
    - **Feature** The Excel Style Filter dialog and its sub-dialogs now have a display density based on the `displayDensity` input of their respective grid.

    ```html
    <igx-drop-down>
        <div class="wrapping-div">
            <igx-drop-down *igxFor="let item of localItems; index as index; scrollOrientation: 'vertical'; containerSize: itemsMaxHeight; itemSize: itemHeight;"
            [value]="item" [index]="index">
                {{ item.data }}

## 7.2.0
- `igxCalendar`
    - `igxCalendar` has been refactored to provide the ability to instantiate each view as a separate component.
    - **Feature** advanced keyboard navigation support has been added. Read up more information in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/tree/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/calendar/README.md)

- **New component** `IgxMonthPicker`:
    - Provides the ability to pick a specific month. Read up more information in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/tree/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/calendar/month-picker/README.md)

- **New component** `IgxHierarchicalGrid`:
    - Provides the ability to represent and manipulate hierarchical data in which each level has a different schema. Each level is represented by a component derived from **igx-grid** and supports most of its functionality. Read up more information about the IgxHierarchicalGrid in the official [documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/hierarchicalgrid.html) or the [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/tree/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/grids/hierarchical-grid/README.md)

- **New component** The `igxSelect` provides an input with dropdown list allowing selection of a single item.
    ```html
    <igx-select #select1 [placeholder]="'Pick One'">
        <label igxLabel>Sample Label</label>
        <igx-select-item *ngFor="let item of items" [value]="item.field">
            {{ item.field }}
        </igx-select-item>
    </igx-select>
    ```

[documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/select) or the [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/tree/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/select/README.md)

- **New directive** `igxAutocomplete` - new directive that provides a way to enhance a text input by showing a panel of suggested options, provided by the developer. More information about the IgxAutocomplete is available in the official [documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/autocomplete) or the [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/tree/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/directives/autocomplete/README.md).

    ```html
    <input igxInput type="text" [igxAutocomplete]="townsPanel" />
    <igx-drop-down #townsPanel>
        <igx-drop-down-item *ngFor="let town of towns" [value]="town">
            {{town}}
        </igx-drop-down-item>
    </igx-drop-down>
    ```

- `igxGrid` now has `isLoading` input property. When enabled will show loading indicator, until the data is available. It can be best utilized for remote scenarios. Another input property `loadingGridTemplate` allows customizing the loading indicator.

    ```html
    <!-- Example -->
    <igx-grid [isLoading]="true" ...>
    </igx-grid>
    ```

    - `Group By`
        - The collapse/expand icons have new orientantion to display the action that will be performed when clicked. When an icon points up clicking on it would result in collapsing the related group row and when it points down clicking on it would expand the group row.
        - The collapse/expand all icons have also been updated to reflect the new group row icons better.
        - Group rows now can be expanded/collapsed using Alt + Arrow Up/Down to reflect the new icons.
    - `filterMode` input added, which determines the filtering ui of the grid. The default value is `quickFilter`. Other possible value is `excelStyle`, which mimics the filtering in Excel with added functionality for column moving, sorting, hiding and pinning.
    - `IgxColumnComponent` now has `disablePinning` property, which determines wether the column can be pinned from
    the toolbar and whether the column pin will be available in the excel style filter menu. The `disableHiding` input will be used to show/hide the column hiding functionality in the menu.
- `igxTreeGrid`
    - The collapse/expand icons have new orientantion to display the action that will be performed when clicked. When an icon points up clicking on it would result in collapsing the related tree grid level and when it points down clicking on it would expand the tree grid level.
    - Expanding/collapsing tree levels can now be performed also by using Alt + Arrow Up/Down to reflect the new icons.
- `IgxColumnComponent`
    - **Breaking Change** the `gridID` property is now **deprecated**. Please, use `column.grid.id` instead.
- `igxCombo`
    - **Breaking Change** `combo.value` is now only a getter.
    - **Feature** added support for templating the default input group of the component. The `igx-combo` now allows for `igx-prefix`, `igx-suffix`,`igx-hint` and `[igxLabel]` components to be passed as `ng-content` and they will be renderer accordingly on the combo's input. Example:
    ```html
        <!-- customize combo input --->
        <igx-combo #myCombo [data]="myGenres">
            ...
            <label igxLabel>Genres</label>
            <igx-prefix><igx-icon>music_note</igx-icon></igx-prefix>
        </igx-combo>
     ```
    - **Feature** the default combo 'clear' and 'toggle' icons can now be templated. Two new directives are added (with selector `[igxComboClearIcon]` and `[igxComboToggleIcon]`). Passing an `ng-template` with one of the directives will overwrite the default conent of the respective icon. Functionality will remain unaffected. Expample:
    ```html
        <!-- customize combo input --->
        <igx-combo #myCombo [data]="myGenres">
            ...
            <ng-template igxComboToggleIcon let-collapsed>
                <igx-icon>{{ collapsed ? 'remove_circle' : 'remove_circle_outline'}}</igx-icon>
            </ng-template>
        </igx-combo>
    ```
- `igxDropDown`
    - `IgxDropDownItemBase` and it's descendants (of which `IgxDropDownItem`) have had their `isSelected` and `isFocused` properties **deprecated**. Instead, use `selected` and `focused` properties.
    - Added an `@Input` for the `index` property (such as the one coming from ngFor) of the `IgxDropDownItem` component. This **deprecates** the automatic index calculation.
    ```html
        <igx-drop-down>
            <igx-drop-down-item *ngFor="let item of items; let i = index" [index]="i">
                {{ item.field }}
            </igx-drop-down-item>
        </igx-drop-down>
    ```
    - **Feature** `IgxDropDownGroupComponent` has been added. It allows for easier grouping of multi-level data, without the need of flattening it. The `igx-drop-down-item-group` tag accepts `igx-drop-down-item`s and displays them in the appropriate grouped fashion.
        ```html
            <igx-drop-down>
                <igx-drop-down-item-group *ngFor="let country of contries" [label]="country.name">
                    <igx-drop-down-item *ngFor="let city of country.cities" [value]='city.refNo'>
                        {{ city.name }}
                    </igx-drop-down-item>
                </igx-drop-down-item-group>
            </igx-drop-down>
        ```
- `Theme Elevations & Shadows` - Components with shadows, set by an elevation level or otherwise, are now fully configurable by the user via schema and/or theme properties. User can also provide a custom elevations set to component themes that support them.
    - **Breaking Change** - The `$search-shadow-color` and `$search-disabled-shadow-color` properties on the `igx-input-group-theme` have been replaced with `$search-resting-shadow` and `$search-disabled-shadow` respectively. Use `ng update` to migrate automatically.
- `IgxTreeGridComponent`
    - We can now search in the treegrid's data by using the `findNext` and the `findPrev` methods and we can clear the search results with the `clearSearch` method.
- `IgxTextHighlightDirective`
    - `IgxTextHighlightDirective.page` input property is **deprecated**. `rowIndex`, `columnIndex` and `page` properties of the `IActiveHighlightInfo` interface are also **deprecated**. Instead, `row` and `column` optional properties are added.
- `igxDragDrop`
    - `dragGhostHost` input property added. Sets the element to which the dragged element will be appended. If not provided, the dragged element is appended to the body.
- `Column Hiding UI`
    - **Behavioral Change** - The UI now hides the columns whose `disableHiding` property is set to true instead of simply disabling them.
- `igxButton` - **New Button Style** - Include [outlined](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#outlined-button) button style to support the latest material spec.
- `igxOverlay`:
    - `igxOverlay.attach()` method added. Use this method to obtain an unique Id of the created overlay where the provided component will be shown. Then call `igxOverlay.show(id, settings?)` method to show the component in overlay. The new `attach` method has two overloads:
      - `attach(element: ElementRef, settings?: OverlaySettings): string` - This overload will create overlay where provided `element` will be shown.
      - `attach(component: Type<any>, settings?: OverlaySettings, moduleRef?: NgModuleRef<any>): string` - Creates a `ComponentRef` from the provided `component` class to show in an overlay. If `moduleRef` is provided the service will use the module's `ComponentFactoryResolver` and `Injector` when creating the `ComponentRef` instead of the root ones.
    - `igxOverlay.show(component, settings)` is **deprecated**. Use `igxOverlay.attach()` method to obtain an Id, and then call `igxOverlay.show(id, settings)` method to show a component in the overlay.
    - `IPositionStrategy` exposes new method `clone` that clones the strategy instance with its settings.

- `igx-date-picker`
    - **Feature** Added `dropdown` `mode` to enable the input field value editing and spinning of the date parts as well as displaying a drop down calendar to select a date. Example:
    ```html
      <igx-date-picker #editableDatePicker1 mode="dropdown" [value]="date" format="dd.MM.y" mask="M/d/y">
      </igx-date-picker>
     ```
 **Components roundness**
- Ignite UI for Angular now allows you to change the shape of components by changing their border-radius.

- Here is the list of all components that have roundness functionality:
* _igx-badge_
* _igx-buttongroup_
* _igx-calendar_
* _igx-card_
* _igx-carousel_
* _igx-chip_
* _igx-dialog_
* _igx-drop-down_
* _igx-expansion-panel_
* _igx-input-group_
* _igx-list_
  * _igx-list-item_
* *igx-navdrawe*r
* _igx-snackbar_
* _igx-toast_
* _igxTooltip_

- **Breaking Change**
- The `$button-roundness` property on the `igx-button-theme` have been replaced for each button type with: `$flat-border-radius`,`$raised-border-radius`,`$outline-border-radius`,`$fab-border-radius`, `$icon-border-radius`.
- The`$roundness` property on the `igx-chip-theme` have been replaced with `$border-radius`.
- The`$roundness` property on the `iigx-tooltip-theme` have been replaced with `$border-radius`.

## 7.1.5
### Features
- `igxGrid`
    - `Group By`
        - The collapse/expand icons have new orientantion to display the action that will be performed when clicked. When an icon points up clicking on it would result in collapsing the related group row and when it points down clicking on it would expand the group row.
        - The collapse/expand all icons have also been updated to reflect the new group row icons better.
        - Group rows now can be expanded/collapsed using Alt + Arrow Up/Down to reflect the new icons.
- `igxTreeGrid`
    - The collapse/expand icons have new orientantion to display the action that will be performed when clicked. When an icon points up clicking on it would result in collapsing the related tree grid level and when it points down clicking on it would expand the tree grid level.
    - Expanding/collapsing tree levels can now be performed also by using Alt + Arrow Up/Down to reflect the new icons.
- `Remove CSS Normalization` - Some users were complaining we reset too many browser styles - lists and heading styles in particular. We no longer do CSS normalization on an application level. Users who depended on our CSS browser normalization will have to handle that on their own going forward.
- `igxOverlayService` - the height of the shown element/component is not cached anymore. The height will be calculated each time position method of position strategy is called.

- `igxOverlayService`
    - `onClosing` event arguments are of type `OverlayClosingEventArgs` that adds an optional `event` property with the original DOM event. The browser event is available when closing of the overlay is caused by an outside click. This also affects all components and directives that use `igxOverlay` service - `igxToggle`, `igxDropDown`, `igxCombo`, `igxSelect` and `igxAutocomplete`. When they emit their respective `onClosing` event, the arguments are of type `CancelableBrowserEventArgs`, including the optional browser event.

## 7.1.4
### Features

- `IgxTimePickerComponent`: in addition to the current dialog interaction mode, now the user can select or edit a time value, using an editable masked input with a dropdown.
- `IgxColumnComponent` now accepts its templates as input properties through the markup. This can reduce the amount of code one needs to write when applying a single template to multiple columns declaratively. The new exposed inputs are:
    + `cellTemplate` - the template for the column cells
    + `headerTemplate` - the template for the column header
    + `cellEditorTemplate` - the template for the column cells when a cell is in edit mode
      ```html
        <!-- Example -->

        <igx-grid ...>
            <igx-column *ngFor="let each of defs" [cellTemplate]="newTemplate" ...></igx-column>

    - Added a new `igxToolbarCustomContent` directive which can be used to mark an `ng-template` which provides a custom content for the IgxGrid's toolbar ([#2983](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/2983))
    - Summary results are now calculated and displayed by default for each row group when 'Group By' feature is enabled.
    - `clearSummaryCache()` and `recalculateSummaries()` methods are deprecated. The grid will clear the cache and recalculate the summaries automatically when needed.
	- `locale` property added. Default value is `en`. All child components will use it as locale.
    - **Breaking change** `IgxSummaryOperand.operate()` method is called with empty data in order to calculate the necessary height for the summary row. For custom summary operands, the method should always return an array of `IgxSummaryResult` with proper length.
- `IgxIconModule`:
    - **Breaking change** `igxIconService` is now provided in root (providedIn: 'root') and `IgxIconModule.forRoot()` method is deprecated.
    - **Breaking change** `glyphName` property of the `igxIconComponent` is deprecated.
- `IgxColumnComponent`:
    - **Breaking change** the `filters` input now expects `IgxFilteringOperand` instance, instead of class ref. This way custom `IgxFilteringOperands` no longer need to be singleton, with defined `instance` method.
- `IgxMask`:
    - `placeholder` input property is added to allow developers to specify the placeholder attribute of the host input element that the `igxMask` is applied on;
    - `displayValuePipe` input property is provided that allows developers to additionally transform the value on blur;
    - `focusedValuePipe` input property is provided that allows developers to additionally transform the value on focus;
- `IgxTreeGrid`:
    - Batch editing - an injectable transaction provider accumulates pending changes, which are not directly applied to the grid's data source. Those can later be inspected, manipulated and submitted at once. Changes are collected for individual cells or rows, depending on editing mode, and accumulated per data row/record.
    - You can now export the tree grid both to CSV and Excel.
    - The hierarchy and the records' expanded states would be reflected in the exported Excel worksheet.
    - Summaries feature is now supported in the tree grid. Summary results are calculated and displayed for the root level and each child level by default.
- `IgxOverlayService`:
    - `ElasticPositioningStrategy` added. This strategy positions the element as in **Connected** positioning strategy and resize the element to fit in the view port in case the element is partially getting out of view.

## 6.2.3
- `igxGrid`
    - `resourceStrings` property added, which allows changing/localizing strings for component. If a new instance is set,
    the changes will be applied to the particular instance of the component:
    ```typescript
        this.grid.resourceStrings = {
            igx_grid_filter: 'My filter',
            igx_grid_filter_row_close: 'My close'
        };
    ```

    ```typescript
        this.grid.resourceStrings.igx_grid_filter = 'My filter';
    ```
- `igxTimePicker`:
    - `resourceStrings` property added, which allows changing/localizing strings for component.

    in the application.
    - Added an util function `getCurrentResourceStrings` that returns current resource strings for all components.
- `ISortingEpression`:
    - The `ignoreCase` and `strategy` properties are moved back to optional, and the `DefaultSortingStrategy` is now injected by the `IgxSorting`, instead of being mandatory to pass to expressions.

## 6.2.0
- Updated typography following the Material guidelines. Type system is now also optional and can be applied via class to the desired containers. [#2112](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/pull/2112)
  - **Breaking change:** Applications using Ignite UI for Angular now require the `igx-typography` class to be applied on wrapping element, like the body element for instance.

- Display density can be specified by using the injection token `DisplayDensityToken` and providing a value (comfortable, cosy or compact) on an application or a component level.

    Setting display density on a component level:
    ```typescript
    @Component({
    ...
    providers: [{ provide: DisplayDensityToken, useValue: { displayDensity: DisplayDensity.compact} }]
    })
    ```
- `igx-input-group`
    - The `igx-input-group` control's display density can be explicitly set by using the `displayDensity` input.
    ```html
    <igx-input-group [displayDensity]="'cosy'"> ... </igx-input-group>
    ```
- `igx-drop-down`:
    - Added a new boolean argument `cancel` to the `onSelection` `ISelectionEventArgs`. Its default value is false, in case it is set to true, the drop down selection is invalidated.
- `igxIcon`:
    - **Breaking change** `glyphName` property is removed from `IgxIconComponent`. For `Material` icons the icon name should be explicitly defined between the opening and closing tags. `Font Awesome` icons should use the `name` property now.
    - Added support for custom SVG icons. Register the SVG icons with the `IgxIconService` and use `IgxIconComponent`'s `name` and `fontSet` properties to visualize the icon.
- Transaction Provider - `TransactionService` is an injectable middleware that a component can use to accumulate changes without affecting the underlying data. The provider exposes API to access, manipulate changes (undo and redo) and discard or commit all to the data.
For more detailed information, see the [README](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/services/transaction/README.md).
- `igxTreeGrid`:
    - New `IgxTreeGridComponent` added.
    - The `igxTreeGrid` is used to display and manipulate hierarchical data with consistent schema, formatted as a table and provides a line of advanced features such as sorting, filtering, editing, column pinning, column moving, column hiding, paging and others.
    - The `igxTreeGrid` provides two ways of defining the relations among our data objects - by using a **child collection** for every data object or by using **primary and foreign keys** for every data object.
    - For more details on using the `igxTreeGrid`, take a look at the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/treegrid).
- `igxGrid`:
    - **Breaking change** `onGroupingDone` - The array of `ISortingExpression` can now be accessed through the `expressions` event property. Two new properties have been added to the event arguments - `groupedColumns` and `ungroupedColumns`. They provide references to arrays of `IgxColumnComponent` that hold the columns which have changed their state because of the **last** grouping/ungrouping operation.

    - **Breaking change** `onEditDone` event is renamed to `onCellEdit` and new cell editing events are introduced: `onCellEditEnter` and `onCellEditCancel`. When row editing is enabled, the corresponding events are emitted by the grid - `onRowEditEnter`, `onRowEdit`, `onRowEditCancel`. All these events have arguments that are using the `IGridEditEventArgs` interface.

    - Row editing - allows modification of several cells in the row, before submitting, at once, all those changes to the grid's data source. Leverages the pending changes functionality of the new transaction provider.

        ```html
        <igx-grid [data]="data" [rowEditable]="true">
            <igx-column field="ProductName"></igx-column>
            <igx-column field="ReleaseDate"></igx-column>
        </igx-grid>
        ```

    - Batch editing - an injectable transaction provider accumulates pending changes, which are not directly applied to the grid's data source. Those can later be inspected, manipulated and submitted at once. Changes are collected for individual cells or rows, depending on editing mode, and accumulated per data row/record.

        ```typescript
        @Component({
            providers: [{ provide: IgxGridTransaction, useClass: IgxTransactionService }],
            selector: "app-grid-with-transactions",
            template: "<ng-content></ng-content>"
        })
        export class GridWithTransactionsComponent { }
        ```
    - A new boolean `hideGroupedColumns` input controls whether the grouped columns should be hidden as well (defaults to false).
    - **Breaking change** `cellClasses` input on `IgxColumnComponent` now accepts an object literal to allow conditional cell styling.
    - Exposing a mechanism for cells to grow according to their content.
    - `sortStrategy` input exposed to provide custom sort strategy for the `IgxColumnComponent`. The custom strategy should implement the `ISortingStrategy` interface, or can extend the base `SortingStrategy` class and override all or some of its public/protected members.
    - New quick filtering functionality is implemented. Filtering icon is removed from column header and a filtering row is introduced in the grid's header.
- `igxFor`
    - Added support for variable heights.
- `igx-datePicker` selector is deprecated. Use `igx-date-picker` selector instead.
- `igxOverlay`:
    - `OverlaySettings` now also accepts an optional `outlet` to specify the container where the overlay should be attached.
    - when `show` and `hide` methods are called `onAnimation` event fires. In the arguments of this event there is a reference to the `animationPlayer`, `animationType` (either `open` or `close`) and to the overlay id.
    - if you call `show`/`hide` methods of overlay, while opening/closing animation is still ongoing, the animation will stop and respective open/close animation will start.
- `igxToggleAction` new `outlet` input controls the target overlay element should be attached. Provides a shortcut for `overlaySettings.outlet`.
- `IgxOverlayOutlet` directive introduced to mark an element as an `igxOverlay` outlet container. [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/directives/toggle/README.md)
- `igxButtonGroup`
    - Added the ability to define buttons directly in the template

    - Introduced `specialDates`. This property is exposed from the `igx-calendar` component.
    - Introduced `deselectDate` method added that deselects the calendar date.
- `IgxTextHighlightDirective`: The `highlight` method now has a new optional parameter called `exactMatch` (defaults to false).
    - If its value is false, all occurrences of the search text will be highlighted in the group's value.
    - If its value is true, the entire group's value should equals the search text in order to be highlighted (caseSensitive argument is respected as well).
- `IgxGrid`: The `findNext` and `findPrev` methods now have a new optional parameter called `exactMatch` (defaults to false).
    - If its value is false, all occurrences of the search text will be highlighted in the grid's cells.
    - If its value is true, the entire value of each cell should equals the search text in order to be highlighted (caseSensitive argument is respected as well).
- `IgxChip`
    - Introduced event argument types to all `EventEmitter` `@Output`s.
    - **Breaking change** `onSelection`'s EventEmitter interface property `nextStatus` is renamed to `selected`.
    - **Breaking change** Move the location of where the chip `suffix` is positioned. Now it is between the content and the `remove button` making the button last element if visible by default.
    - **Breaking change** Remove the chip `connector` rendered when using the `igxConnector` directive that is also removed.
    - **Breaking change** The chip theme has been rewritten. Most theme input properties have been renamed for consistency
    and better legibility. New properties have been added. Please, refer to the updated igx-chip-theme documentation to see all updates.
    - Exposed original event that is responsible for triggering any of the events. If triggered by the API it is by default `null`.
    - Added `data` input for storing any data related to the chip itself.
    - Added `select icon` with show/hide animation to indicate when a chip is being selected with ability to customize it while retaining the chip Material Design styling.
    - Added `selectIcon` input to set custom template for the `select icon`.
    - Update chip styling to match Material Design guidelines.
    - Rework of the chip content styling so now by default text inside is styled to match the chip Material Design styling.
    - Rework of the `remove button` rendered and now has the ability to customize its icon while retaining the chip Material Design.
    - Added `removeIcon` input so a custom template cane be set for the remove button icon.
- `IgxChipArea`
    - Introduced event argument types to all `EventEmitter` `@Output`s.
    - Exposed original event that is responsible for triggering any of the events. If triggered by the API it is by default `null`.
- `IgxCombo`
    - Added the following directives for `TemplateRef` assignment for combo templates (item, footer, etc.):
        - Added `IgxComboItemDirective`. Use `[igxComboItem]` in markup to assing a TemplateRef to `combo.itemTemplate`.
        - Added `IgxComboHeaderDirective`. Use `[igxComboHeader]` in markup to assing a TemplateRef to `combo.headerTemplate`.
        - Added `IgxComboFooterDirective`. Use `[igxComboFooter]` in markup to assing a TemplateRef to `combo.footerTemplate`.
        - Added `IgxComboEmptyDirective`. Use `[igxComboEmpty]` in markup to assing a TemplateRef to `combo.emptyTemplate`.
        - Added `IgxComboAddItemirective`. Use `[igxComboAddItem]` in markup to assing a TemplateRef to `combo.addItemTemplate`.
        - Added `IgxComboHeaderItemDirective`. Use `[igxComboHeaderItem]` in markup to assing a TemplateRef to `combo.headerItemTemplate`.
    - **Breaking change** Assigning templates with the following template ref variables is now deprecated in favor of the new directives:
            `#itemTemplate`, `#headerTemplate`, `#footerTemplate`, `#emptyTemplate`, `#addItemTemplate`, `#headerItemTemplate`.
    - **Breaking change** `height` property is removed. In the future `IgxInputGroup` will expose an option that allows custom sizing and then `IgxCombo` will use the same functionality for proper styling and better consistency.

- `IgxDropDown`
    - **Breaking change** `allowItemsFocus` default value is changed to `false`.
    - Added `value` input to `IgxDropDownItemComponent` definition. The property allows data to be bound to a drop-down item so it can more easily be retrieved (e.g. on selection)
- `igx-calendar`:
    - Introduced `disabledDates` property which allows a user to disable dates based on various rules: before or after a date, weekends, workdays, specific dates and ranges. The disabled dates cannot be selected and have a distinguishable style.
    - Introduced `specialDates` property which allows a user to mark dates as special. They can be set by using various rules. Their style is distinguishable.
    - Introduced `deselectDate` method added that deselects date(s) (based on the selection type)
- `igxExpansionPanel`:
    - component added. `igxExpansionPanel` provides a way to display more information after expanding an item, respectively show less after collapsing it. For more detailed information see the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/expansion-panel).
- `IgxList`:
    - the control now supports **ng-templates** which are shown "under" a list item when it is left or right panned. The templates are distinguished using the `igxListItemLeftPanning` and `igxListItemRightPanning` directives set on the templates.
    - the IgxList's `onLeftPan` and `onRightPan` events now have an argument of type `IListItemPanningEventArgs` (instead of `IgxListItemComponent`). The event argument has the following fields:
        - **item** of type `IgxListItemComponent`
        - **direction** of type `IgxListPanState`
        - **keepItem** of type `boolean`
- `igxTooltip` and `igxTooltipTarget` directives:
    - Added `IgxTooltipDirective`.
        - An element that uses the `igxTooltip` directive is used as a tooltip for a specific target (anchor).
        - Extends `IgxToggleDirective`.
        - Exported with the name **tooltip**.
    - Added `IgxTooltipTargetDirective`.
        - An element that uses the `igxTooltipTarget` directive is used as a target (anchor) for a specific tooltip.

        - Exported with the name **tooltipTarget**.
    - Both new directives are used in combination to set a tooltip to an element. For more detailed information, see the [README](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/directives/tooltip/README.md).
- `igxToggle`:
    - Introduced reposition method which allows a user to force toggle to reposition according its position strategy.
- `IgxDrag` and `IgxDrop` directives available.
    - `IgxDrag` allows any kind of element to be moved/dragged around the page without changing its position in the DOM. Supports Desktop/Mixed/Touch environments.
    - `IgxDrop` allows any element to act as a drop area where any `igxDrag` element can be dragged into and dropped. Includes default logic that moves the dropped element from its original position to a child of the `igxDrop` element.
    - Combined they provide a way to move elements around the page by dragging them. For more detail see the [README](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/directives/dragdrop/README.md).
- `IgxGrid` keyboard navigation
When you focus a specific cell and press one of the following key combinations, the described behaviour is now performed:
    - `Ctrl + Arrow Key Up` - navigates to the first cell in the current column;
    - `Ctrl + Arrow Down` - navigates to the last cell in the current column;
    - `Home` - provide the same behavior as Ctrl + Arrow Left - navigates to the first cell from the current row;
    - `End` - provide the same behavior as Ctrl + Arrow Right - navigates to the last cell from the current row;
    - `Ctrl + Home` - navigates to the first cell in the grid;
    - `Ctrl + End` - navigates to the last cell in the grid;
    - `Tab` - sequentially move the focus over the next cell on the row and if the last cell is reached move to next row. If next row is group row the whole row is focused, if it is data row, move focus over the first cell;
    - `Shift + Tab` - sequentially move focus to the previous cell on the row, if the first cell is reached move the focus to the previous row. If previous row is group row focus the whole row or if it is data row, focus the last cell of the row;
    - `Space` over Cell - if the row is selectable, on keydown space triggers row selection
    - `Arrow Left` over GroupRow - collapse the group row content if the row is not already collapsed;
    - `Arrow Right` over GroupRow - expand the group row content if the row is not already expanded;
    - on mouse `wheel` the focused element is blurred;
    - **Breaking change**  `space` handler for the group row has been removed; so `Space` does not toggle the group row;
    - **Breaking change** cell selection is preserved when the focus is moved to group row.
    - Introduced `onFocusChange` event. The event is cancelable and output argument from type `IFocusChangeEventArgs`;
    - For more detailed information see the [official keyboard navigation specification](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/igxGrid-Specification#kb-navigation).

## 6.1.9

### General

- `sortStrategy` input exposed to provide custom sort strategy for the `IgxColumnComponent`. The custom strategy should implement the `ISortingStrategy` interface, or can extend the base `DefaultSortingStrategy` class and override all or some of its public/protected members.
- The previously optional `ignoreCase` and `strategy` of the `ISortingExpression` interface are no longer optional. In order to use our default sorting strategy in expressions built programmatically, you need to pass `DefaultSortingStrategy.instance()` or any implementation of the `ISortingStrategy` interface.

## 6.1.0
- `igxOverlay` service added. **igxOverlayService** allows you to show any component above all elements in page. For more detailed information see the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/overlay-main)
- Added **igxRadioGroup** directive. It allows better control over its child `igxRadio` components and support template-driven and reactive forms.
- Added `column moving` feature to `igxGrid`, enabled on a per-column level. **Column moving** allows you to reorder the `igxGrid` columns via standard drag/drop mouse or touch gestures.
    For more detailed information see the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/column-moving).
- `igx-tab-bar` selector removed from `IgxBottomNavComponent`.
- `igxGrid` filtering operands
- `igxGrid`
    - **Breaking change** `filter_multiple` method is removed. `filter` method and `filteringExpressionsTree` property could be used instead.
    - **Breaking change** `filter` method has new signature. It now accepts the following parameters:
        - `name` - the name of the column to be filtered.
        - `value` - the value to be used for filtering.
        - `conditionOrExpressionTree` - (optional) this parameter accepts object of type `IFilteringOperation` or `IFilteringExpressionsTree`. If only a simple filtering is required a filtering operation could be passes (see bellow for more info). In case of advanced filtering an expressions tree containing complex filtering logic could be passed.
        - `ignoreCase` - (optional) - whether the filtering would be case sensitive or not.
    - **Breaking change** `onFilteringDone` event now have only one parameter - `IFilteringExpressionsTree` which contains the filtering state of the filtered column.
    - `filter_global` method clears all existing filters and applies the new filtering condition to all grid's columns.
    - filtering operands:
        - **Breaking change** `IFilteringExpression` condition property is no longer a direct reference to a filtering condition method, instead it's a reference to an `IFilteringOperation`
        - 5 filtering operand classes are now exposed
            - `IgxFilteringOperand` is a base filtering operand, which can be inherited when defining custom filtering conditions
            - `IgxBooleanFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `boolean` types
            - `IgxNumberFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `numeric` types
            - `IgxStringFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `string` types
            - `IgxDateFilteringOperand` defines all default filtering conditions for `Date` types
        - `IgxColumnComponent` now exposes a `filters` property, which takes an `IgxFilteringOperand` class reference
            - Custom filters can now be provided to grid columns by populating the `operations` property of the `IgxFilteringOperand` with operations of `IFilteringOperation` type
```
export class IgxCustomFilteringOperand extends IgxFilteringOperand {
    // Making the implementation singleton
    private static _instance: IgxCustomFilteringOperand = null;

    protected constructor() {
        super();
        this.operations = [{
            name: 'custom',
            logic: (target: string) => {
                return target === 'My custom filter';
            }
        }].concat(this.operations); // Keep the empty and notEmpty conditions from base
    }

    // singleton
    // Must implement this method, because the IgxColumnComponent expects it
    public static instance(): IgxCustomFilteringOperand {
        return this._instance || (this._instance = new this());
    }
}
```

- `igxGrid` now supports grouping of columns enabling users to create criteria for organizing data records. To explore the functionality start off by setting some columns as `groupable`:
    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data">
        <igx-column [field]="'ProductName'"></igx-column>
        <igx-column [field]="'ReleaseDate'" [groupable]="true"></igx-column>
    </igx-grid>
    ```
   For more information, please head over to `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md) or the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/groupby).

- `igxGrid` now supports multi-column headers allowing you to have multiple levels of columns in the header area of the grid.
    For more information, head over to [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/multi-column-headers)
- `igxGrid` theme now has support for alternating grid row background and text colors.
- `igxGrid` now has a toolbar (shown using the `showToolbar` property) which contains the following features:
  - title (specified using the `toolbarTitle` property)
  - column hiding feature (enabled using the `columnHiding` property)
  - column pinning feature (enabled using the `columnPinning` property)
  - export to excel (enabled using the `exportExcel` property)

    - **Breaking change** updateRow(value: any, rowSelector: any) method will update the specified row only if the primary key is defined. The method accept value and rowSelector as a parameter, which is the rowID.
    - **Breaking change** updateCell(value: any, rowSelector: any, column: string) method will update the specified cell only if the primary key is defined. The method accept  value, rowSelector,which is the rowID and column name.
    - getCellByKey(rowSelector: any, columnField: string) method is added to grid's API. This method retuns a cell or undefined only if primary key is defined and search for the specified cell by the rowID and column name.
    - getCellByColumn(rowIndex: number, columnField: string) method is updated. This method returns a cell or undefined by using rowIndex and column name.
- `IgxGridRow` API is updated:
    - update(value: any) method is added. The method takes as a parameter the new value, which is to be set to the specidied row.
    - delete() method is added. The method removes the specified row from the grid's data source.

- `igxCell` default editing template is changed according column data type. For more information you can read the [specification](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/Cell-Editing) or the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/editing)
- `igxCombo` component added

    ```html
    <igx-combo #combo [data]="towns" [displayKey]="'townName'" [valueKey]="'postCode'" [groupKey]="'province'"

        <igx-drop-down-item *ngFor="let item of items" disabled={{item.disabled}} isHeader={{item.header}}>
                {{ item.field }}
        </igx-drop-down-item>
    </igx-drop-down>
    ```

    **igxDropDown** displays a scrollable list of items which may be visually grouped and supports selection of a single item. Clicking or tapping an item selects it and closes the Drop Down.

    A walkthrough of how to get started can be found [here](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/drop-down)

    igxDropdown features:

        - Single Selection
        - Grouping
        - Keyboard Navigation
        - Accessibility compliance

            <label igxLabel>{{chip.text}}</label>
        </igx-chip>
    </igx-chips-area>
    ```

    For more detailed information see the [official igxChip documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/chip).

- `igxToggle` changes
    - `onOpening` event added.
    - `onClosing` event added.
- `igxToggleAction` new `overlaySettings` input controls how applicable targets display content. Provides defaults with positioning based on the host element. The `closeOnOutsideClick` input is deprecated in favor of the new settings and will be removed in the future.

- `igxList` now supports a 'loading' template which is shown when the list is empty and its new `isLoading` property is set to `true`. You can redefine the default loading template by adding an `ng-template` with the `igxDataLoading` directive:

    ```html
    <igx-list [isLoading]="true">
        <ng-template igxDataLoading>
            <p>Please wait, data is loading...</p>
        </ng-template>
    </igx-list>
    ```

- **Breaking changes**:
    - Removed submodule imports. All imports are now resolved from the top level `igniteui-angular` package.
    - `igxGrid` changes:
        - sort API now accepts params of type `ISortingExpression` or `Array<ISortingExpression>`.
    - `igxToggle` changes
        - `collapsed` now read-only, markup input is removed.
        - `onOpen` event renamed to `onOpened`.
        - `onClose` event renamed to `onClosed`.
        - `open` method does not accept fireEvents optional boolean parameter. Now it accepts only overlaySettings optional parameter of type `OverlaySettings`.
        - `close` method does not accept fireEvents optional boolean parameter.
        - `toggle` method does not accept fireEvents optional boolean parameter. Now it accepts only overlaySettings optional parameter of type `OverlaySettings`.
    - `igxDialog` changes
        - `open` method does not accept fireEvents boolean parameter. Now it accepts only overlaySettings optional parameter of type `OverlaySettings`.
- **Breaking change** All properties that were named `isDisabled` have been renamed to `disabled` in order to acheive consistency across our component suite. This affects: date-picker, input directive, input-group, dropdown-item, tabbar and time-picker.
- The **deprecated** `igxForRemote` input for the `igxFor` directive is now removed. Setting the required `totalItemCount` property after receiving the first data chunk is enough to trigger the required functionality.

## 6.0.4
- **igxRadioGroup** directive introduced. It allows better control over its child `igxRadio` components and support template-driven and reactive forms.
- Fixed ReactiveForms validations support for IgxInputGroup. Related [issue](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/1144).

## 6.0.3
- **igxGrid** exposing the `filteredSortedData` method publicly - returns the grid data with current filtering and sorting applied.

## 6.0.2
- **igxGrid** Improve scrolling on mac [#1563](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/pull/1563)
- The `ng update igniteui-angular` migration schematics now also update the theme import path in SASS files. [#1582](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/issues/1582)

## 6.0.1
- Introduced migration schematics to integrate with the Angular CLI update command. You can now run

  `ng update igniteui-angular`

  in existing projects to both update the package and apply any migrations needed to your project. Make sure to commit project state before proceeding.
  Currently these cover converting submodule imports as well as the deprecation of `igxForRemote` and rename of `igx-tab-bar` to `igx-bottom-nav` from 6.0.0.
- **Breaking changes**:
    - Removed submodule imports. All imports are now resolved from the top level `igniteui-angular` package. You can use `ng update igniteui-angular` when updating to automatically convert existing submodule imports in the project.
    - Summary functions for each IgxSummaryOperand class has been made `static`. So now you can use them in the following way:
    ```typescript
    import { IgxNumberSummaryOperand, IgxSummaryOperand } from "igniteui-angular";
    class CustomSummary extends IgxSummaryOperand {
    constructor() {
      super();
    }
    public operate(data?: any[]) {
      const result = super.operate(data);
      result.push({
        key: "Min",
        label: "Min",
        summaryResult: IgxNumberSummaryOperand.min(data)
      });
      return result;
    }
  }
    ```


## 6.0.0
- Theming - You can now use css variables to style the component instances you include in your project.
- Added `onDoubleClick` output to `igxGrid` to emit the double clicked cell.
- Added `findNext`, `findPrev` and `clearSearch` methods to the IgxGridComponent which allow easy search of the grid data, even when the grid is virtualized.
- Added `IgxTextHighlightDirective` which highlights parts of a DOM element and keeps and updates "active" highlight.
- Added `All` option to the filter UI select for boolean columns
- Update to Angular 6

## 5.3.1
- igx-dialog changes
    - Dialog title as well as dialog actions (buttons) can be customized. For more information navigate to the [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/dialog/README.md).
- Filtering a boolean column by `false` condition will return only the real `false` values, excluding `null` and `undefined`. Filtering by `Null` will return the `null` values and filtering by `Empty` will return the `undefined`.
- The `Filter` button in the filtering UI is replaced with a `Close` button that is always active and closes the UI.
- Filtering UI input displays a `X` icon that clears the input.

## 5.3.0
- Added `rowSelectable` property to `igxGrid`
    - Setting `rowSelectable` to `true` enables multiple row selection for the `igx-grid` component. Adds a checkbox column that allows (de)selection of one, multiple or all (via header checkbox) rows.
    - For more information about the `rowSelectable` property and working with grid row, please read the `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md) about selection or see the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/selection)
- Added `onContextMenu` output to `igxGrid` to emit the clicked cell.
- `igx-datePicker`: Added `onClose` event.
- `igxTextSelection` directive added
    - `igxTextSelection` directive allows you to select the whole text range for every element with text content it is applied.
- `igxFocus` directive added
    - `igxFocus` directive allows you to force focus for every element it is applied.
- `igx-time-picker` component added
    - `igx-time-picker` allows user to select time, from a dialog with spinners, which is presented into input field.
    - For more information navigate to the [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/time-piker/README.md).
- `igx-tab-bar` changes
    - **Breaking changes**: `IgxTabBarComponent` is renamed to `IgxBottomNavComponent` and `IgxTabBarModule` is renamed to `IgxBottomNavModule`.
    - `igx-tab-bar` selector is deprecated. Use `igx-bottom-nav` selector instead.
- `igx-tabs` component added
    - `igx-tabs` allows users to switch between different views. The `igx-tabs` component places the tabs headers at the top and allows scrolling when there are multiple tab items outside the visible area. Tabs are ordered in a single row above their associated content.
    - For more information navigate to [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/tabs/README.md).
- Added column pinning in the list of features available for `igxGrid`. Pinning is available though the API. Try the following:
   ```typescript
   const column = this.grid.getColumnByName(name);
   column.pin();
   ```
   For more information, please head over to `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md) or the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/column-pinning).
- Added `summaries` feature to `igxGrid`, enabled on a per-column level. **Grid summaries** gives you a predefined set of default summaries, depending on the type of data in the column.
    For more detailed information read `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md) or see the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/summaries).
- Added `columnWidth` option to `igxGrid`. The option sets the default width that will be applied to columns that have no explicit width set. For more detailed information read `igxGrid`'s [ReadMe](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/grid/README.md)
- Added API to `igxGrid` that allows for vertical remote virtualization. For guidance on how to implement such in your application, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/virtualization)
- Added smooth scrolling for the `igxForOf` directive making the scrolling experience both vertically and horizontally much more natural and similar to a native scroll.
- Added `onCellClick` event.
- `igxForOf` now requires that its parent container's `overflow` is set to `hidden` and `position` to `relative`. It is recommended that its height is set as well so that the display container of the virtualized content can be positioned with an offset inside without visually affecting other elements on the page.
    ```html
    <div style='position: relative; height: 500px; overflow: hidden'>
        <ng-template igxFor let-item [igxForOf]="data" #virtDirVertical
                [igxForScrollOrientation]="'vertical'"
                [igxForContainerSize]='"500px"'
                [igxForItemSize]='"50px"'
                let-rowIndex="index">
                <div style='height:50px;'>{{rowIndex}} : {{item.text}}</div>
        </ng-template>
    </div>
    ```
- Removed the `dirty` local template variable previously exposed by the `igxFor` directive.
- The `igxForRemote` input for the `igxFor` directive is now **deprecated**. Setting the required `totalItemCount` property after receiving the first data chunk is enough to trigger the required functionality.
- the `igx-icon` component can now work with both glyph and ligature-based icon font sets. We've also included a brand new Icon Service, which helps you create aliases for the icon fonts you've included in your project. The service also allows you to define the default icon set used throughout your app.
- Added the option to conditionally disable the `igx-ripple` directive through the `igxRippleDisabled` property.
- Updated styling and interaction animations of the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components.
- Added `indeterminate` property and styling to the `igx-checkbox` component.
- Added `required` property to the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-radio`, and `igx-switch` components.
- Added `igx-ripple` effect to the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components. The effect can be disabled through the `disableRipple` property.
- Added the ability to specify the label location in the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components through the `labelPosition` property. It can either be `before` or `after`.
- You can now use any element as label on the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components via the aria-labelledby property.
- You can now have invisible label on the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` components via the aria-label property.
- Added the ability to toggle the `igx-checkbox` and `igx-switch` checked state programmatically via `toggle` method on the component instance.
- Added the ability to select an `igx-radio` programmatically via `select` method on the component instance.
- Fixed a bug on the `igx-checkbox` and `igx-radio` components where the click event was being triggered twice on click.
- Fixed a bug where the `igx-checkbox`, `igx-switch`, and `igx-radio` change event was not being triggered on label click.
- `igxМask` directive added
    - `igxМask` provide means for controlling user input and formatting the visible value based on a configurable mask rules. For more detailed information see [`igxMask README file`](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/src/directives/mask/README.md)
- `igxInputGroup` component added - used as a container for the `igxLabel`, `igxInput`, `igxPrefix`, `igxSuffix` and `igxHint` directives.
- `igxPrefix` directive added - used for input prefixes.
- `igxSuffix` directive added - used for input suffixes.
- `igxHint` directive added - used for input hints.
- `igxInput` directive breaking changes:
    - the directive should be wrapped by `igxInputGroup` component
    - `IgxInputGroupModule` should be imported instead of `IgxInputModule`
- `igxExcelExportService` and `igxCSVExportService` added. They add export capabilities to the `igxGrid`. For more information, please visit the [igxExcelExportService specification](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/IgxExcelExporterService-Specification) and the [igxCSVExportService specification](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/CSV-Exporter-Service-Specification).
- **General**
    - Added event argument types to all `EventEmitter` `@Output`s. #798 #740
    - Reviewed and added missing argument types to the following `EventEmitter`s
        - The `igxGrid` `onEditDone` now exposes arguments of type `IGridEditEventArgs`. The arguments expose `row` and `cell` objects where if the editing is performed on a cell, the edited `cell` and the `row` the cell belongs to are exposed. If row editing is performed, the `cell` object is null. In addition the `currentValue` and `newValue` arguments are exposed. If you assign a value to the `newValue` in your handler, then the editing will conclude with the value you've supplied.
        - The `igxGrid` `onSelection` now correctly propagates the original `event` in the `IGridCellEventArgs`.
    - Added `jsZip` as a Peer Dependency.
- `primaryKey` attribute added to `igxGrid`
    - `primaryKey` allows for a property name from the data source to be specified. If specified, `primaryKey` can be used instead of `index` to indentify grid rows from the `igxGrid.rowList`. As such, `primaryKey` can be used for selecting rows for the following `igxGrid` methods - `deleteRow`, `updateRow`, `updateCell`, `getCellByColumn`, `getRowByKey`
    - `primaryKey` requires all of the data for the specified property name to have unique values in order to function as expected.
    - as it provides a unique identifier for each data member (and therefore row), `primaryKey` is best suited for addressing grid row entries. If DOM virtualization is in place for the grid data, the row `index` property can be reused (for instance, when filtering/sorting the data), whereas `primaryKey` remains unique. Ideally, when a persistent reference to a row has to be established, `primaryKey` should be used.
- **Theming**
    - Added a `utilities` module to the theming engine to allow for easier import of theming functions and mixins, such as igx-color, igx-palette, igx-elevation, etc. To import the utilities do ```@import '~igniteui-angular/core/styles/themes/utilities';```

## 5.2.1
- `hammerjs` and `@types/hammerjs` are removed from `peerDependencies` and were added as `dependencies`. So if you are using Igniteui-Angular version 5.2.1 or above it is enough to run `npm install igniteui-angular` in your project for getting started. For more detailed information see [`Ignite UI for Angular Getting Started`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/getting-started)
- `web-animations-js` is added as Peer Dependency.
- `Theming` bug fixes and improvements.
- Use the following command to generate `Ignite UI for Angular Themes` documentation - `npm run build:docs`. Navigate to `dist/docs/sass` and open `index.html` file.

## 5.2.0
- `igxForOf` directive added
    - `igxForOf` is now available as an alternative to `ngForOf` for templating large amounts of data. The `igxForOf` uses virtualization technology behind the scenes to optimize DOM rendering and memory consumption. Virtualization technology works similar to Paging by slicing the data into smaller chucks which are swapped from a container viewport while the user scrolls the data horizontally/vertically. The difference with the Paging is that virtualization mimics the natural behavior of the scrollbar.
- `igxToggle` and `igxToggleAction` directives added
    - `igxToggle` allows users to implement toggleable components/views (eg. dropdowns), while `igxToggleAction` can control the
      `igxToggle` directive. Refer to the official documentation for more information.
    - `igxToggle` requires `BrowserAnimationsModule` to be imported in your application.
- [`Ignite UI for Angular Theming`](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/themes) - comprehensive set of **Sass** functions and mixins will give the ability to easily style your entire application or only certain parts of it.
    - Previously bundled fonts, are now listed as external dependencies. You should supply both the [Material Icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) and [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/selection?selection.family=Titillium+Web:300,400,600,700) fonts yourself by either hosting or using CDN.
- `igx-grid` changes
    - The component now uses the new `igxForOf` directive to virtualize its content both vertically and horizontally dramatically improving performance for applications displaying large amounts of data.
    - Data-bound Input property `filtering` changed to `filterable`:

    ```html
    <igx-grid [data]="data">
        <igx-column [field]="'ReleaseDate'" [header]="'ReleaseDate'"
            [filterable]="true" dataType="date">
        </igx-column>
    </igx-grid>
    ```

    - @HostBinding `min-width` added to `IgxGridCellComponent` and `IgxGridHeaderCell`
    - The IgxGridCellComponent no longer has a value setter, but instead has an `update` modifier.

    ```html
    <ng-template igxCell let-cell="cell">
        {{ cell.update("newValue") }}
    </ng-template>
    ```
    - Class `IgxGridFiltering` renamed to `IgxGridFilteringComponent `
